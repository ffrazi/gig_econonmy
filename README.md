## Problem Statement

India's food delivery partners (Zomato and Swiggy) earn an estimated ₹15,000–₹25,000 per month. This income drops by 20–30% during external disruptions. Chennai records more than 45 heavy-rain days annually, Delhi experiences AQI levels above 300 for extended periods, and unplanned strikes can eliminate an entire day's earnings overnight.

These workers have no income safety net: no employer support, no sick pay, and no disruption coverage. When a cyclone halts deliveries in Chennai, a typical partner permanently loses ₹600–₹900.

GigShield is an AI-enabled parametric insurance platform that automatically pays food delivery partners when measurable external triggers — heavy rain, extreme heat, severe AQI, cyclones, or curfews — cross predefined thresholds. No claim filing. No waiting period. No possibility of denial.

## User Persona: Food Delivery Partner (Zomato / Swiggy)

### Profile
- Name: Ravi (representative persona)  
- Location: Chennai, Tamil Nadu  
- Platform: Zomato / Swiggy (dual-registered)  
- Working hours: 8–12 hours/day, 6 days/week  
- Weekly earnings: ₹3,500 – ₹6,000  
- Device: Android smartphone (primary); no laptop  
- Payment: Weekly UPI credit from platform  

### Pain Points
- Daily earnings fall from ₹500–₹800 to ₹0–₹200 on rainy days.  
- Disruptions cannot be predicted in advance.  
- Monthly insurance premiums are unaffordable due to irregular income.  
- Traditional claims require paperwork and proof that workers rarely possess.  
- Low trust in claim-based insurance due to frequent rejections.  

### Key Insight
Ravi does not need to file a claim. He needs to receive payment automatically when disruption occurs — exactly the way his weekly Zomato/Swiggy payout arrives in his UPI account. GigShield is designed to mirror that seamless experience.

```

### Step-by-Step Journey

1. Onboarding (under 5 minutes)  
- Registration using mobile number and Zomato/Swiggy partner ID.  
- Aadhaar verification via DigiLocker API.  
- Selection of primary delivery zone (pin code).  
- UPI ID linkage for instant payouts.  
- AI automatically generates initial risk profile from zone data.

2. Risk Profiling (AI-Driven)  
- Machine-learning model assigns a risk score (0–100) per pin code using:  
  - Historical weather severity (IMD data, last 3 years)  
  - AQI frequency  
  - Flood/waterlogging records  
  - Local strike/curfew patterns  
- The risk score directly determines the applicable premium bracket.

3. Policy Activation  
- Worker selects one of three weekly tiers (₹49 / ₹89 / ₹149).  
- Coverage runs Monday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59 and auto-renews.  
- Pause or cancel anytime before the next cycle.

4. Real-Time Monitoring  
- System polls authoritative APIs every 15 minutes.  
- Trigger thresholds are evaluated against the worker’s active zone.  
- Delivery activity is cross-validated with platform data.

5. Automatic Payout  
- Confirmed trigger triggers background fraud validation (< 60 seconds).  
- Approved payout is credited instantly to the linked UPI ID.  
- SMS and in-app notification delivered with amount and reason.

## Weekly Premium Model

### Rationale for Weekly Pricing
Zomato and Swiggy pay partners on a weekly cycle. GigShield aligns perfectly:  
- No large upfront commitment.  
- Premium can be auto-deducted from platform earnings (future partnership opportunity).  
- Workers can pause coverage during planned leaves without financial loss.

### Pricing Tiers

| Plan            | Weekly Premium | Maximum Weekly Payout | Best Suited For                  |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Starter Shield  | ₹49            | ₹500                  | New partners, low-risk zones     |
| Active Shield   | ₹89            | ₹1,200                | Regular workers, moderate risk   |
| Full Shield     | ₹149           | ₹2,500                | High-frequency, high-risk zones  |

### Dynamic Pricing Formula (AI-Adjusted)
```text
Final Weekly Premium = Base Tier Premium × Zone Risk Multiplier × Seasonal Factor × Loyalty Discount

Zone Risk Multiplier   = 0.8 – 1.4 (ML-derived per pin code)  
Seasonal Factor        = 1.0 – 1.3 (monsoon: June–September)  
Loyalty Discount       = 0.95 after 4 weeks; 0.90 after 12 weeks
```

Example: Ravi in Velachery (flood-prone Chennai zone) during August monsoon:  
`₹89 × 1.3 (zone risk) × 1.3 (season) × 1.0 = ₹150` → capped at ₹149 (Full Shield).

The multipliers are produced by an XGBoost regression model trained on IMD rainfall archives, CPCB AQI records, and income-loss surveys, and are updated quarterly.

## Parametric Triggers

Scope: Loss of income only. No coverage for vehicle damage, health, or accidents.  
All triggers are objective, verifiable, and zone-specific.

### Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                | Threshold                              | Data Source                  | Payout (% of Daily Average) |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Heavy Rainfall         | ≥ 35 mm in any 3-hour window           | IMD / Tomorrow.io            | 70%                         |
| Extreme Heat           | ≥ 43 °C for ≥ 4 consecutive hours      | OpenWeatherMap               | 50%                         |
| Severe AQI             | AQI ≥ 300                              | CPCB / IQAir                 | 40%                         |
| Cyclone / Flood Alert  | IMD Red Alert for worker’s district    | IMD Warning API              | 100%                        |
| Local Curfew / Strike  | Section 144 or verified hartaal        | Government notifications     | 80%                         |

### Payout Calculation
```text
Daily Average Income = Worker’s actual 4-week average (platform data)
Triggered Payout     = Daily Average × Payout % × Duration Factor
Weekly Cap           = Plan maximum (₹500 / ₹1,200 / ₹2,500)
```

Example: Ravi’s 4-week average = ₹700/day. Chennai records 47 mm rain on Tuesday → payout = ₹700 × 70% = ₹490 credited the same evening.

## Compliance & Scope

- Covered: Income loss due to weather, AQI, flood, cyclone, or verified local curfew/strike.  
- Excluded: Health, life, vehicle repair, or accident coverage.  
- Pricing: Weekly model only.  
- Target users: Zomato and Swiggy delivery partners exclusively.

---

## Innovation Highlights

1. Fully automated, zero-touch claims — detection, validation, and payment occur without worker intervention.  
2. Hyper-local risk pricing at pin-code level using machine learning.  
3. Weekly subscription aligned with platform payout cycles, with built-in loyalty discounts.  
4. Predictive disruption alerts that help workers optimise coverage before high-risk periods.  
5. Payouts calibrated to each worker’s actual recent earnings rather than fixed flat amounts.
